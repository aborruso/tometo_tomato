## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher) installed.

For efficient package management, we recommend [uv](https://astral.sh/uv) — a modern and fast tool for managing Python environments.

## Method 1: Install from Source (for Development)

This method is ideal if you want to contribute to the project or modify the code.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aborruso/tometo_tomato.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tometo_tomato
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    *   **With `uv` (recommended):**

        ```bash
        uv sync
        ```

        This creates a virtual environment and installs the package in editable mode, so code changes take effect immediately.

    *   **With `pip`:**

        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```

    If you don't plan to modify the code, you can omit the `-e` flag:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Method 2: Install as a Global Tool (with `uv tool install`)

If you just want to use `tometo_tomato` as a command-line tool without managing source code or virtual environments, `uv tool install` is the cleanest option.

1.  **Make sure you have `uv` installed.**
2.  **Install the tool:**

    ```bash
    uv tool install tometo_tomato
    ```

    This installs `tometo_tomato` in an isolated environment managed by `uv` and makes it available on your PATH.

## Verify the Installation

After completing any of the installation methods, verify that `tometo_tomato` is installed correctly:

```bash
tometo_tomato --version
```

You should see the version number printed on screen.
